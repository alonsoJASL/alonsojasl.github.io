# List of main personal projects and collaborations 
## Main repositories 
+ [CemrgApp](https://github.com/CemrgDevelopers/CemrgApp) is an MITK based 
  interactive medical imaging application with image processing and computer 
  vision toolkits for cardiovascular research. 
  
+ [macrosight](https://github.com/alonsoJASL/macrosight) is a MATLAB software 
  designed to analyse 3-layered images of macrophages moving. It uses the 
  [PhagoSight](https://github.com/phagosight/phagosight) algorithms and adapts
  it to images with overlapping cells. 
  
## Additional repositories 
+ [SplitVent](https://github.com/splitvent/splitvent) A Simulated 
  Single Ventilator/Dual Patient Ventilation Strategy for Acute Respiratory 
  Distress Syndrome during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

+ [Anglegram](https://github.com/alonsoJASL/matlab.anglegram) is a MATLAB software
  designed to analyse the shape of the boundary of binary objects through the 
  measurement of the inner angles in the boundary. We have developed anglegram 
  to detect junctions.  

+ [PhagoSight](https://github.com/phagosight/phagosight), I **collaborate**
  often for this code, which analyses fluorescent microscopy time-lapse
  videos of neutrophils and other cells. You can read more about it 
  in [here.](phagosight.org)
