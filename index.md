# About
I am a postdoc researcher at the Cardio Electro Mechanics Research Group 
[CEMRG](www.cemrg.com), where I currently develop image processing and 
computer vision algorithms for the analysis of cardiac images.
I am a PhD Researcher at [City, University of London](https://goo.gl/yVQBfX),
working in (bio)medical image analysis in cell tracking and shape analysis
at the Research Centre for Biomedical Engineering
[(RCBE).](https://www.city.ac.uk/biomedical-engineering-research-centre)
You can find more about my research project [here](https://goo.gl/doP13n).


## A brief background
I graduated from Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de México (ITAM) in Telematics Engineering 
(2013) and Applied Mathematics (2014). My PhD was in Biomedical Image Analysis working at the 
School of Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering (SMCSE) at City, University of London, 
in particular [(RCBE).](https://www.city.ac.uk/biomedical-engineering-research-centre). 
My [PhD research](https://goo.gl/yVQBfX) focused on the automated analysis of moving patterns 
in migrating cells’ movement.
