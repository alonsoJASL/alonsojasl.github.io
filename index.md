# about
I am a Senior Software Engineer at Imperial College London, where I design and maintain production-grade data pipelines and software platforms for cardiovascular imaging research. My work sits at the intersection of software engineering and clinical practice: building systems that are reliable, maintainable, and usable by clinicians and researchers without software expertise.

# background
I hold a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from City, University of London, and dual degrees in Applied Mathematics and Telematics Engineering from Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM). I have over six years of professional experience building data-intensive systems in clinical research environments, with deep expertise in Python backend architecture, containerised workflows, and CI/CD.

# selected projects
+ [pycemrg](https://github.com/OpenHeartDevelopers): Modular Python library suite for cardiovascular research engineering, featuring contract-driven architecture, CLI tooling, and Docker-based deployment workflows.
+ [CardioForm](https://github.com/OpenHeartDevelopers/cardio-form): Containerised ML inference service for automated cardiac segmentation, with model versioning, output validation, and CLI orchestration.
+ [cardioscar](https://github.com/alonsoJASL/cardioscar): Production refactor of a published TensorFlow training pipeline to PyTorch, achieving a 36x training speedup while maintaining statistical equivalence with the original model.
+ [CemrgApp](https://github.com/CemrgAppDevelopers/CemrgApp): C++ clinical imaging platform for cardiovascular research, used across 40+ international studies.
